Dynamics of wholesale electricity prices
=========================================

Ensuring a clean and sustainable future power system requires multiple 
initiatives, including reducing electricity consumption by introducing 
energy efficient appliances, phasing out of old fossil fuel fired power 
plants, introducing clean alternate energy sources like wind and solar. 
While these initiatives are indispensable for a smooth energy transition, 
it should be noted that each of these factors significantly contribute 
to the changing dynamics of wholesale electricity price. The figure here 
shows rapid phasing out of large central power plants in both price areas 
of Denmark. Replacing such costly units with resources like wind and solar 
- that have near zero marginal price and inherently fluctuating nature - 
can be both economically and technically challenging.

Introducing large shares of inexpensive renewable energy sources in the 
generation mix eventually causes a drop in the average wholesale electricity 
price. Additionally, this also creates situations where periods of low price 
periods (zero or even negative) emerge more frequently than ever before. This 
figure here shows how such periods of low price hours have increased over the 
years along side the growing renewable shares in the generation mix. In the 
early dawn of large scale renewable integration many researchers envisioned 
that an increasing frequency of low price periods should be compensated by 
simultaneously increasing the frequency of high price periods. It was expected 
that large shares of intermittent generations from wind and solar will reduce 
load factors on conventional generations, and to compensate for their revenues, 
an increased frequency of high price periods will emerge during times of 
generation scarcity.

Increasing frequency of both high as well as low price periods can potentially 
cause escalating system strain and increased volatility. However, in reality, 
these expectations did not quite materialize. The figures here show that while 
low price periods display a clear upward trend in both DK1 and DK2, high price 
periods did not follow similar pattern. This indicates successful management 
and smart implementation of capacity mechanisms have hindered the occurrence 
of scarcity situations, thereby reducing the frequency of high price periods.
In the adjacent figure, high and low price periods are calculated by analyzing 
values above 99-percentile and below 1-percentile, respectively. The respective 
values were 82.9 and 0.1 Euro for DK1 and 98.3 and 2.8 Euro for DK2.
